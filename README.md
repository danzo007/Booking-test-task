# Booking-test-task
Yesterday when I did the task and ran the code and logged into the account, because of this I was considered a bot and blocked that account, I need to confirm that I am not a bot, you need to go to email and confirm it, but because I do not have access to your email, I created a booking on my mail and called it the same way as the account was named form test task Test West, so all the differences only in the values in the file .env where all data for login is taken from, by default there is .env file with my data from booking, but if you want to run tests with data from test task, you need to confirm on email message that everything is ok with account and delete .env file with my data or rename it and file which is named 1.env must be renamed to .env and then everything will work with data from test task, sorry for this, tried to make everything as comfortably as possible)
